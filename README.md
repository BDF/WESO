# WESO

WESO is acronym for Washtenaw Elementary Science Olympiad.   I wrote this as a volunteer project for 
the local elementary school to streamline and track which science olympiad events the grade school
participated in.

It was also a learning project for Tapestry since at the time I was inheriting a large body of code at 
work which uses Tapestry.   The code at that layer is a mess but the code at the service layer is solid.
